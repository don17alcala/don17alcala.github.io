    <h3>Oh, were halfway there!</h3>

       <p>
          Well, here we are halfway through the semester and I think its going well even with a bad case of senioritis.
          With midterms finished and I feel like it is all downhill to graduation.
          Thanks for a great semester so far and I look foward to whats next on my journey.</p>

    <h3>Classes I am taking this semester.</h3>

    <ul>

        <li> Global Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weekend Update!</h2>

       <p>
        After work on Friday I decided to knock out all of my midterm exams which went
        suprisingly well. I had Global Water Concerns, Human Geography and wrote short analysis on New Zealand.
        On Saturday I took the rail downtown and met up with a friend for lunch and a movie.
        We watched the obscure Japanese 1977 horror film Hausu, ate cheese curds and fresh popcorn in a small indie movie theater.
        Sunday was nothing more than relaxation and pizza. I have to say all in all a pretty good weekend.
