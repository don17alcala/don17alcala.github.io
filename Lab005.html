    <h3>How is my semester going?</h3>

       <p>
           This semester has been going surprisingly well so far.
           I have been trying to keep my head above water, which is not always easy.
           I was initially nervous about taking on too much, starting a new job, moving, and starting my semester all within the same month.
           As with most things in life stressing out about the situation rarely helps.
           What I did was take it one situation at a time so that issues did not get compounded.
           It’s amazing how fast time is going and right now that’s not a bad thing. I will be happy to with school for a while.
           It has been an amazing journey, but I think I have had enough school for a while.
           Maybe in a few years if the opportunity presents itself, I will work on my master’s degree.
           However, for the time being I am going to hang up the old protractor and enjoy building my career. </p>

    <h2>What I did last weekend!</h2>

       <p>
        After the hustle and bustle of the work week I try to take a day to do something I enjoy.
        After sleeping in a bit Saturday morning, I met up with a friend of mine and went to the movies where we saw Venom.
        I was a little up in the air about the film, but it turned out to be well done and I would recommend it for a midafternoon movie, not really work $18.
        On Sunday I decided to take my pup and camera to Mount Rainer for the first time.
        On the two hour drive out there I was a little worried that we would not be able to see the mountain, as there was heavy fog and light rain.
        Luckily, once we gained a little elevation the clouds broke up and the sunshine came out.
        I have to say that it is one of the more impressive sights to be seen and highly recommend the trip.
       </p>
