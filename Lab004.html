    <h2>How my semester is going</h2>
        
       <p>
           This semester has been going suprisingly well so far. I have been trying to keep my head above water, which is not always easy. I was initially nervous about taking on too much, starting a new job, moving and 
           starting my semester all within the same month. As with most things in life stressing out about the situaiton rarley helps. What I did was take it one situation     
           at a time so that issues did not get compounded. Its really amazing how fast time is going and right now thats not a bad thing. I will be happy to with school for a while. It has
           been an amazing journey but I think I have had enough school for a while. Maybe in a few years if the opprotunity presents itself I will work on my Master Degree. However for the time being I am going 
           to hang up the old protractor and enjoy building my career. </p>
